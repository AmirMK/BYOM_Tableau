Solving this problem requires a dynamic interaction with multiple machine learning models. The models are built outside of Tableau with Python, and then Tableau Analytics Extensions API had been used as a deployment platform to mingle the models together and make it accessible through Tableau platforms. Hence, the business users will be able to interact with these models in real time.
